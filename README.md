Herolo/Abra Home Assignment - Weather App

OVERVIEW
write a simple, responsive, web app in angular/react that shows the weather of some city. The
user should be able to search for a city and save it to favorites (locally, a server is not required).
We expect to see 2 pages in this app. (weather page and favorites page).
We recommend you to use a 3rd party UI library (material, prime, bootstrap, etc)

API
The API that you’ll use for this app is AccuWeather API . Please signup and create a new app in
order to get an API key.
You will use 3 endpoints: location autocomplete for the search field, get current weather and
5-day daily forecast . Please read those API docs.
NOTE: this API is limited to 50 requests per day. our recommendation is to save the responses
and use them locally during development.

GOALS
1. Show us your coding skills - We want to see your strengths, don’t be afraid to go wild, add
features and customize the design.
2. Readability - Your code should be readable and self-explanatory with minimum
comments. Remove any unused code, console logs, and files. Use logical project
structure and code separation.
